Requirements:

$ apt-get install mongodb
$ npm install


Next steps:
- document setting up db
  - (maybe use a dbsetup route?)
- set up config.js.tmpl and add config.js to .gitignore

- set up connection to external source
- pull name from external source
- bundle name with pricing info and return to user
- add a 404 response for unknown product IDs
